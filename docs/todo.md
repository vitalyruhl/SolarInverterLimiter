# ToDo SolarInverterLimiter

- Refactor the code to new structure of ConfigManager. Use /dev-info/Example_V2.4.7_xxx.x as reference. the Configmanager is in C:\Daten\_Codding\ESP32\ConfigurationsManager. use this Path as reference.
- check the HomeAssistant_XXX.yaml files for errors and update them to the new structure.
- Use new Logging and mqttManager module from /dev-info/helpers/xxx as reference.(there are newer versions of these modules) - i will refactor these modules in the next days. to own modules for better versioning. make the folder structure so, that i can later use these modules in other projects without much changes.
