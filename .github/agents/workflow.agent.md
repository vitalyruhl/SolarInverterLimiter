# Workflow Agent

Purpose:
Provide repository workflow rules for branches, issues, PRs, checkpoints,
release branches, and explicit session-close handling.

This agent must apply `.github/AGENTS.md`.

## Branch Model

- `main` is the published/released branch.
- `release/*` branches are runnable snapshot branches and must stay buildable and
  runnable.
- `release/*` branches are versioned by release, for example `release/v4.0.0`
  or `release/v4.1.0`.
- `feature/*` branches are work-in-progress branches and may be unfinished or
  temporarily broken.
- Work on one side branch at a time.
- Do not change `main` directly.
- Docs-only TODO updates under `docs/todo.md` or `docs/todo_*.md` may be
  committed directly to `main` when the user explicitly requests that workflow.

## Git Command Rules

- Read-only git commands may be run without asking:
  - `git status`
  - `git diff`
  - `git log`
  - `git show`
  - `git branch`
  - `git remote -v`
- Commands that modify history or working tree require confirmation:
  - `git add`
  - `git commit`
  - `git switch` / `git checkout`
  - `git reset`
  - `git merge`
  - `git rebase`
  - `git clean`
  - `git stash`
  - `git cherry-pick`
- Stage, commit, and push only on explicit user request or when a named workflow
  explicitly requires it.
- If staging is requested, prefer `git add -A`.
- Do not prepend `Set-Location` to git commands. Use the configured working
  directory. For non-git commands that must change directory, use
  `Push-Location` / `Pop-Location`.

## Branch Safety

- Before multi-file refactors or risky changes, ensure the current baseline is
  understood and either clean, committed, or intentionally dirty by user request.
- Work incrementally: fix, verify, checkpoint or commit only when requested, then
  continue.
- Verify the active branch matches the task.
- If the active branch is `main` or `master`, emit a `[W]` warning before
  file-changing work.
- If branch naming does not match the task, warn and propose suitable branch
  names instead of silently switching.
- Never revert user edits unless explicitly asked.

## GitHub Workflow

- Prefer `gh` for PRs, CI checks, and issues when available.
- Keep PRs scoped to one coherent change.
- Do not claim merge readiness without running or reporting the relevant
  validation.
- GitHub Issue titles and bodies created by agents must be written in English.
- GitHub Pull Request titles and descriptions created by agents must be written
  in English.
- GitHub comments created by agents should be written in English unless the user
  explicitly requests otherwise.
- Internal chat with the user may remain informal German; do not use that as a
  reason to create German GitHub issue or PR text by default.
- Use GitHub Issues or PRs as task tracking when the user asks for tracked
  workflow, but do not invent mandatory project-board rules for this repository.
- GitHub Project usage is optional and controlled by `.github/AGENTS.md`
  `Tracking Policy`.
- When `Current GitHub Project` is `none`:
  - do not require project-board actions
  - do not report missing project-board state as a blocker
  - do not require project item status changes
  - do not require documentation or TODO synchronization into a project board
- When a concrete GitHub Project is configured later, workflow rules may use it
  as an optional coordination mechanism for issue, PR, and project status.
- Issues and PRs remain allowed regardless of GitHub Project configuration.

## PlatformIO Workflow

- Default build validation:
  - `pio run -e usb`
- OTA environment validation, when explicitly relevant:
  - `pio run -e ota`
- Upload commands require explicit user request because they interact with
  hardware or network devices.
- Serial monitor commands require explicit user request because they attach to
  local devices.
- If no `.cpp` or `.h` files changed, skip PlatformIO build unless requested.

## Release Branch Workflow

- `release/*` branches should represent runnable snapshots.
- Prefer fast-forward updates when moving a release branch to a verified feature
  state.
- If fast-forward is not possible, ask explicitly before force-pushing. Prefer
  `--force-with-lease` if force-push is approved.
- Do not invent semantic-version or `pyproject.toml` release steps for this
  repository unless the repository later adds such files and policy.

## Workflow Shortcuts

These names describe expected intent if the user invokes them:

- `workflow.begin`: prepare the correct branch for a new task.
- `workflow.checkpoint`: create a commit and push the current coherent state.
- `workflow.docs`: perform a narrow documentation-only synchronization.
- `workflow.audit`: read-only workflow or repository-state audit.
- `workflow.ship`: build and verify artifacts without implicit merge.
- `workflow.ready`: prepare work for review or integration, run or report
  relevant validation, do not merge to `main`, do not update `release/*`, and do
  not push unless explicitly requested or covered by a named workflow.
- `workflow.toMain`: get validated work onto `main` through the agreed workflow.
- `workflow.cleanBranches`: delete only branches verified as integrated.
- `workflow.end`: inspect repository state and report current branch, changed
  files, validation state, and blockers without claiming merge or fix success.
  Do not commit, push, merge, or update release branches unless explicitly
  requested.

Shortcut behavior must remain conservative:

- Inspect repository state first.
- Avoid destructive operations.
- Report blockers plainly.
- Do not create parallel branch lines for the same work.

## Mandatory Reporting

Report:

- current branch
- files changed when relevant
- git actions performed
- validation run
- validation skipped with reason
- release branch updates if any
- remaining blockers or risks
