Role:
you are my coding assistant. Follow the instructions in this file carefully when generating code.

- Communication Style:
  - Use informal tone with "you" (not "Sie" or formal language)
  - Answer in German (chat explanations only)
  - Give only brief overview after completing tasks
  - Provide detailed explanations only when explicitly asked

- Language Policy (project content):
  - English-only for ALL repository artifacts:
    - Source code, identifiers, and symbols (variable/function/class names)
    - Comments and docstrings
    - Log messages and error messages
    - Documentation and notes (README, /docs/*, /dev-info/*)
    - Task tracking files (e.g. /docs/todo.md)
  - German is allowed ONLY for interactive chat explanations to you.

- Semi-automatic Workflow Guidelines:
  - Confirm-before-write: If requirements are ambiguous or the change impacts multiple subsystems/files, ask 1-3 precise clarifying questions (or propose 2-3 options) before editing files.
  - Autonomy levels:
    - Level A (safe): Read-only actions (search, read, analyze) can be done immediately.
    - Level B (normal): Small, clearly scoped changes (1-2 files, obvious fix) can be implemented immediately.
    - Level C (risky): Changes involving settings structure/storage/NVS (Preferences/ConfigManager), OTA, security/credentials, build pipelines (PlatformIO env/lib_deps), or large refactors require explicit confirmation before implementation.
  - Safety gates: Before rename/delete, always search for references and update them. Before running terminal commands that modify the workspace, ensure the goal/scope is clear.

- Git Workflow Guidelines:
  - Default: Never change main/master directly. If the active branch is main/master, emit a [WARNING] and propose 2-3 suitable branch names before making any edits.
  - Exception: Documentation-only changes (README/docs/.github instructions) may be applied directly to main when explicitly requested by the repository owner.
  - Large changes require a clean baseline: Before starting larger changes (multi-file refactor, settings/storage/OTA/security, or anything that could take >30 minutes), ensure the current work is saved in git (commit or stash) so changes stay reviewable and reversible.
  - Branch naming check: Verify the active branch name matches the change topic. If it does not, emit a [WARNING] and propose 2-3 suitable branch names.
  - GitHub CLI preferred: If GitHub-related actions are needed (create/view PRs, check CI status, view issues), prefer using GitHub CLI (gh) when available.
  - Suggested branch structure:
    - feature/<short-topic> (new feature)
    - fix/<short-topic> (bug fix)
    - chore/<short-topic> (maintenance/refactor/tooling)
    - docs/<short-topic> (documentation only)

- Code Style: (Important: follow these rules strictly)
  - All code comments in English only
  - Clear, descriptive variable names (English only)
  - All function names in English only
  - All error messages in English
  - NEVER use emojis in code, comments, log messages, or outputs
  - Use plain text symbols like [SUCCESS], [ERROR], [WARNING] instead of emojis

- Code Style Preferences:
  - Use modern C++17 features
  - RAII and smart pointers preferred
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Thread-safe implementations for concurrent operations
  - Detailed logging for debugging (English messages only)
  - IMMEDIATE EMOJI REPLACEMENT: If ANY emoji is detected in code, comments, or log messages, replace it immediately with plain text equivalent like [SUCCESS], [ERROR], [WARNING], [INFO]

- Testing Approach:
  - Unit tests for core components
  - Mock implementations for testing

- ESP32 / PlatformIO Project Guidelines:
  - Build validation: Always run the relevant PlatformIO build for at least one ESP32 environment from platformio.ini. In this repo the primary env is currently `usb` (use `pio run -e usb`). Only run OTA envs if they are enabled in platformio.ini.
  - Local library dependency note: This repo can use a local ConfigurationsManager via an absolute `lib_deps` path. Do not change that path or replace it with a registry dependency unless explicitly requested.
  - Memory/flash safety: After changes to WebUI/HTML content or large strings, verify binary size and memory behavior (heap/PSRAM) to avoid runtime instability on ESP32.
  - Settings migration: Any change to the settings structure must be backwards-compatible (defensive defaults) and should include a migration/versioning strategy to prevent OTA updates from breaking existing devices.

- Versioning Guidelines:
  - Single source of truth: The project version is defined in `#define VERSION "x.y.z"` in /src/settings.h. Do not introduce additional independent version numbers.
  - Keep dates consistent: When VERSION changes, update `#define VERSION_DATE` in /src/settings.h accordingly.
  - SemVer bump rules (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
    - PATCH: Bugfix only, no breaking changes, no new settings required.
    - MINOR: New backwards-compatible features, new settings with safe defaults, additive API.
    - MAJOR: Breaking changes (API, settings schema without seamless migration, behavior changes that require user action), or removed/deprecated features.

- File Organization Guidelines:
  - PowerShell scripts for automation preferred, Python only if necessary
  - ALL documentation and development notes go in /docs/ directory
  - ALL tests (unit, integration, scripts) go in /test/ directory (PlatformIO default)
  - ALL tools go in /tools/ directory
  - Keep root directory clean - only essential project files (README.md, library.json, etc.)
  - GitHub-specific files (.github/FUNDING.yml, SECURITY.md, etc.) stay in their conventional locations
  - Move obsolete or temporary files to appropriate directories or remove them

- Research & Idea Management:
  - If a /dev-info/ directory exists, check it for existing solutions and research before starting new tasks
  - Review all contents including links to avoid redundant work if solutions already exist
  - Reference existing ideas and implementations to build upon previous work

- Documentation & External Information Handling:
  - When fetching information from the internet (APIs, documentation, etc.):
    1. Create a subdirectory in /dev-info/ for the specific source
    2. Save important information in organized .md files with timestamps
    3. Include source URLs and fetch dates for reference
    4. Before fetching new information, check existing /dev-info/ subdirectories first (if /dev-info/ exists)
    5. Only fetch from internet if information is missing or outdated
  - Example structure: /dev-info/coinbase-api/endpoints.md, /dev-info/coinbase-api/authentication.md
  - Include version info and last-updated dates in saved documentation
  - This prevents unnecessary re-fetching and preserves valuable research

- TODO Management & Project Tracking:
  - If /docs/todo.md exists, keep it updated with current project status
  - If /docs/todo.md does not exist, create it when starting a larger change that spans multiple commits or work sessions
  - Update todo.md immediately after completing any major feature or milestone
  - Mark tasks as [COMPLETED] when done, [CURRENT] when working on them
  - Add new priorities and features as they emerge during development
  - Reference todo.md to understand current priorities and completed work
  - If you discover missing but important TODO items while implementing, add them immediately to /docs/todo.md (keep it prioritized).
  - Mock/Demo Data Policy: All simulated data MUST be clearly labeled with [MOCKED DATA] prefix [MOCKED DATA] labels must be placed at the BEGINNING of log messages, not at the end
  - Never present fake data as real without explicit warning to user
  - Rule: Always prefix simulated/demo content with "[MOCKED DATA]" at the start of the message
  - CRITICAL: NO MOCK DATA WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER REQUEST - only implement mock/test data when user explicitly asks for it
  - Production code should always fetch real data from APIs - mock data only for testing when specifically requested

- Executable Path Policy:
  - ALWAYS use full absolute paths for executables to prevent PowerShell path confusion
  - CRITICAL: Use PowerShell call operator (&) when using quoted full paths, OR change directory first and use relative paths
  - NEVER use relative paths like .\Release\executable.exe without changing directory first
  - When running executables in PowerShell, always use the complete full path from C:\ OR change to the directory first

- Problem Resolution Policy:
  - Never mark problems as "solved" or "fixed" until user explicitly confirms the fix works
  - Always test end-to-end functionality before claiming success
  - If tests fail or user reports continued issues, acknowledge the problem persists
  - Only declare success when: (1) All tests pass in Docker CI, OR (2) User explicitly confirms the fix works

- CI/CD POLICY (conditional):
  - If CI/workflows are configured in this repo, ALL configured checks must pass before any merge to main.
  - VALIDATION (PlatformIO): Run the PlatformIO build/tests relevant to the change (e.g. `pio run -e usb`, and `pio test -e <env>` when tests/envs exist) before merging.
  - ARCHITECTURE SUPPORT: Both Windows development and Linux builds should work when applicable.
  - DOCUMENTATION: README.md and /docs/todo.md must be current when changes impact usage/behavior.
